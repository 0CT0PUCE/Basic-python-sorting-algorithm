# sorting
Just a basic Python script that sort files from one folder into other folders.
Make sure to change the path to your personal folder from the line 5 to 18.
Then just run the script, a tkinter window will open, just put the path to the folder that you want to sort and click "sort".
The programm will tell you how much file were moved/deleted during the process.
